# The Coding Spectrum

The purpose of this application is to provide a basic social educational application for beginners at web/software development. Do you remember the reading rainbow when you were a kid? Well, that was before we had internet children. Twenty years later, guess what, every thing is automated! So screw the reading rainbow! Put down your books kids and lets go learn to code!


## Story Line

As a user, I can create an account and login to The Coding Spectrum. I have my own profile that I can build for myself. In my own profile view, I can update my personal information, avatar, and so on. I can see my own history of blog posts, a list of my friends, pending friend requests from other users, as well as sent friend requests on your behalf.

Users can use the blog to ask questions by rendering their code in a post, where other users can comment. A user's post has the ability to accumulate likes from other users on the platform.

Users can also hold a discussion through comments on the video lesson. Please feel free to clone down the project and check it out!
